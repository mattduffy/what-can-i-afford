This mortgage calculator can be used to figure out monthly payments of a home mortgage loan, based on the home's sale price, the term of the loan desired, buyer's down payment percentage, and the loan's interest rate. This calculator factors in PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) for loans where less than 20% is put as a down payment. Also taken into consideration are the town property taxes, and their effect on the total monthly mortgage payment.

Residential (or Property) Taxes are a little harder to figure out... In Massachusetts, the average resedential tax rate seems to be around $14 per year for every $1,000 of your property's assessed value. 

Let's say that your property's assessed value is 85% of what you actually paid for it - $381,650.00. This would mean that your yearly residential taxes will be around $5,343.10 This could add $445.26 to your monthly payment.
TOTAL Monthly Payment:	$2,072.43
(including residential tax)


1	The down payment = The price of the home multiplied by the percentage down divided by 100 (for 5% down becomes 5/100 or 0.05)

$112,250.00 = $449,000.00 X (25 / 100)
2	The interest rate = The annual interest percentage divided by 100

0.041 = 4.1% / 100
The monthly factor = The result of the following formula:
3	The monthly interest rate = The annual interest rate divided by 12 (for the 12 months in a year)

0.0034166666666667 = 0.041 / 12
4	The month term of the loan in months = The number of years you've taken the loan out for times 12

360 Months = 30 Years X 12
5	The montly payment is figured out using the following formula:
Monthly Payment = 33675000 * (00034 / (1 - ((1 + 00034)-(360)))) 

The amortization breaks down how much of your monthly payment goes towards the bank's interest, and how much goes into paying off the principal of your loan.
