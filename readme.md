# I Want To Purchase My First Home

Buying a house can be a complex and confusing prospect.  Especially for a first time buyer.

There are lots of issues to deal with, and some potentially foriegn concepts to learn.  

Applying and qualifying for a mortgage can be more complicated than it may first appear
on the surface.  Just because you qualify for a certain loan amount, there may be many 
additional hidden, or at the very least - less visible - costs associated with the 
mortgage or purchase that can dramatically increase the monthly costs.

The goal of this app is to, hopefully, construct a much more financially accurate cost
breakdown of a home purchase.  This app will include as many expenses beyond the basic
APR values, such as:

__Realtor Related Costs__
* potential penalties for finding a property on your own
* time spent traveling

__Making an Offer__
* earnest money
* escrow fees
* ???

__Morgage Related Costs__
* loan origination fees 
* possible loan point purchase
* upfront mortgage insurance
* new homeowner insurance premium
* ???

__Settlement Related Costs__ 
* appraisal and assessment fees
* inspection fees
* possible property tax due
* ???

__After The Purchase Costs__
* monthly costs of garbage service
* monthly costs of water service
* monthly costs of heating and electric utilities
* possible monthly HOA fees
* ???

These less than visible costs associated with the purchase of a new home can quickly 
balloon a monthly mortgage payment that at first looked reasonalbe, into a potentially 
insurmountable monthly debt load that is unsustainable.
