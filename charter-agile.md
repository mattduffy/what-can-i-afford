# Project Name

### What is the project about?
Give a high-level description of what this project is and what specific need it should fill.  The level of detail should be sufficient to convey the utility of the app without providing too much granualar detail.  The level of detail should be consistent with the 'elevator pitch' concept.  Develop a picture of the app in broad strokes, without concern for implementation specifics.

### Why is the project being undertaken?
This is where the business rational will be explained.  Identify the needs of a class of users that is currently not being met.  Explain how the product of this project will fill those needs.  Avoid providing implementation details, unless they are inextricable from the needs being met.

### Who will be engaged in the project?
A list of stakeholders and participants is provided here.  It is not required that a full and comprehensive list of all stakeholders be given here, as this is likely to change over time through adaptive planning and product refinement processes.  The list of project participants should include all types of team members: designers, engineers, testers, project management staff, etc.  It is not unusual for the project staff to be hired after at later stages of the project as needed, or as resources become available.  It should be noted here when the project team has yet to be assembled.

### When will the project be undertaken?
Give a high-level view of the start and end dates of the project.  Progressive elaboration does not always provide a very exact end date due to the frequently high amount of change accepted in the product design.  However, there should be a relative understanding of the level of effort, within an order of magnitude, required to successfully complete the project.  If available, provide some high-level estimates of when major project milestones are expected, or required to occur.

### Where will the project be undertaken?
A brief description of work site requirements is provided here.  If the project team is virtual, explain how that will be arranged.  If the project team will be co-located, provide any known requirements about facilities.

### How will the project be undertaken?
A brief outline of the management and development approaches to be used on the project is provided here.  Establish a guideline for how those approaches will be followed.  Elaborate as necessary, but remember this is a primarily a conceptual document, not an enforcable contract.  Project details are subject to change.
